# Firebase Slack Extension (Unofficial)

[**Install the extension using this link**](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/extensions/install?ref=nikkothari22/firebase-slack-extension)

**Author**: Nikhil Kothari (**[https://github.com/nikkothari22](https://github.com/nikkothari22)**)

**Description**: Functions to send messages to Slack channels using the Slack API. (Not an official extension)

**This is not an official Slack extension and the author is not associated with Slack or Firebase in any manner whatsoever. All trademarks and copyrights belong to the respective companies.**

**Details**: Use this extension to send messages to your customer's or your own Slack's channel. The extension uses the [Slack chat.postMessage API](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) to send the message.

You need to have a Slack app and get the authentication (Access) token from the user using the OAuth process (refer to the Slack API documentation for this). When you need to send a message to a specific channel of a user, use the Bot Token and channel name to send it to the user.

The extension has a cloud function that's triggered whenever a new document is created in the collection specified during installation.

Here's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:

```js
admin.firestore().collection('slackMessages').add({
  authToken: 'xoxb-your-token-here',
  channel: 'general',
  message: {
    text: 'Hello world. This is a test message'
  },
})
```
